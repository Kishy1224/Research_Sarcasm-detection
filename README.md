# Performance Analysis On Sarcasm Based Data On Different combination of Deep Learning architectures tested on Facebook’s FastText and Google’s Glove embedding. 

<h1>ABSTRACT<\h1>

Sarcasm is a complicated linguistic term commonly found in e-commerce and social media sites. Sarcasm is often used to express a negative opinion using positive or intensified positive words in social media. This intentional ambiguity makes sarcasm detection, an important task of sentiment analysis.  Failure to identify sarcastic utterances in Natural Language Processing applications such as sentiment analysis and opinion mining will confuse classification algorithms and generate false results. Several studies on sarcasm detection have utilised different learning algorithms. In this project we worked on fastText and Global vectors for word representation (GloVe) and have implemented 3 deep learning algorithms namely, CNN+ Bi-LSTM, GRU + Bi-LSTM and Bi-LSTM with glorot uniform weight initializer with various activation functions and optimizers. The main purpose of this project is to compare the accuracy scores of all possible combinations and identify the best performing model, based on the model’s accuracy.
